##### Similar to Javascript where we "throw" errors, in Python we "raise" errors.

##### Exceptions handling:

    1.  The "try" block lets you test a block of code for errors.

    2.  The "except" block lets you handle the error.

    3.  The "else" block lets you execute code when there is no error.

    4.  The "finally" block lets you execute code, regardless of the result of the try- and except blocks.

##### To throw (or raise) an exception, use the **raise** keyword.
