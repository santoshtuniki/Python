##### Consider a module to be the same as a code library.

##### A file containing a set of functions you want to include in your application.

##### Some built-in modules:

	1.  math

	2.  sys

	3.  random

	4.	platform

##### dir()

	A built-in function to list all the function names (or variable names) in a module.

##### __name__

	A property for every module.

##### Custom modules:

	1.	To create a module just save the code you want in a file with the file extension '.py'

	2.	Now we can use the module we just created, by using the import statement
