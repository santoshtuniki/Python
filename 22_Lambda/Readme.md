##### A lambda function is a small anonymous function.

##### A lambda function can take any number of arguments, but can only have one expression.

	lambda arguments : expression


##### A function is called **Higher Order Function** if it contains other functions as a parameter or returns a function as an output 

##### The functions that operate with another function are known as Higher order Functions.


##### Some of the higher order built-in functions include:

	1.	map

		map(func, *iterables) --> map object

	2.	filter

		filter(function or None, iterable) --> filter object

	3.	reduce

		reduce(function, iterable[, initial]) -> value
