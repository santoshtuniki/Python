## Operators

#####  Arithmetic Operators

	+   Addition
		a = 2 + 2   => 4

	-   Subtraction
		a = 4 - 2   => 2

	*   Multiplication
		a = 4 * 2   => 8

	/   Divison             (Results in floating number)
		a = 5 / 2   => 2.5

	//  Floor Division      (Results in floor value of result)
		a = 5 // 2  => 2

	%   Modulus             (Remainder)
		a = 5 % 2   => 1

	**  Exponentinal
		a = 5 ** 2  => 25

	round   Rounding to Nearest
		a = round(5 / 2)  => 3

#####  Assignment Operators    

	+=    x += 3    x = x + 3

	-=    x -= 3    x = x - 3

	*=    x *= 3    x = x * 3

	/=    x /= 3    x = x / 3

	%=    x %= 3    x = x % 3

	//=    x //= 3    x = x // 3

	**=    x **= 3    x = x ** 3

##### Comparison Operators

	==    Equal				x == y    

	!=    Not equal			x != y    

	>    Greater than    	x > y    

	<    Less than    		x < y    

	>=   Greater than or equal to    x >= y    

	<=   Less than or equal to    	x <= y

##### Logical Operators

	and 	Returns True if both statements are true					x < 5 and  x < 10	

	or		Returns True if one of the statements is true				x < 5 or x < 4	

	not		Reverse the result, returns False if the result is true		not(x < 5 and x < 10)
