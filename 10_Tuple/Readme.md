##### Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

##### Tuples are written with round brackets.

##### When we create a tuple, we normally assign values to it. This is called "packing" a tuple

##### But, we are allowed to extract the values back into variables. This is called "unpacking"

##### count(val)

    Returns the count of occurences of element (i.e no. of duplicates)

##### index(val)

    Returns the index of the first occurence

##### A tuple is a collection which is ordered and **unchangeable**
