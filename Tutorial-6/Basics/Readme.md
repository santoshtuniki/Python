### Integers

    Integer, is a whole number, positive or negative, without decimals, of unlimited length.

### Float 

    Float, or "floating point number" is a number, positive or negative, containing one or more decimals.

    Float can also be scientific numbers with an "e" to indicate the power of 10.

        Ex: x = 55e3, y = 1E8, z = -80.7e120

### Complex

    Complex numbers are written with a "j" as the imaginary part

        Ex: x = 3+5j, y = 5j, z = -5j

    x.real()    =>     Returns(float) real part of complex numnber(x)

    x.imag()    =>     Returns(float) imaginary part of complex numnber(x)
