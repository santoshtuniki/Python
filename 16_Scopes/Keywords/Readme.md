### Use the ***global*** keyword if you want to make a change to a global variable inside a function.

### We can't modify the value of global variable from within the funtion directly as it's defined outside of the function.

### To modify global value inside a function, firstly define reference global valriable from within the function & then modify it.

### Use ***nonlocal*** keyword to modify a value of local variable of a parent function from within the nested function.
