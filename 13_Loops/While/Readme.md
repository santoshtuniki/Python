### while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true

### The while loop requires relevant variables to be ready ( initialized before loop starts )

### break 
    
    To stop the loop even if the while condition is true

### continue

    To stop the current iteration, and continue with the next

### else

    To run a block of code once when the condition no longer is true.

    Only if while loop is exited & not in the case with "break"
