##### for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (That is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string.)

##### The for loop does not require an indexing variable to set beforehand.

##### break 
    
    To stop the loop even if the while condition is true

##### continue

    To stop the current iteration, and continue with the next

##### else

    To execute a block of code to be executed when the loop is finished

##### pass

    for loops cannot be empty, but if you for some reason have a for loop with no content, put in the "pass" statement to avoid getting an error

##### range(val)

    To loop through a set of code a specified number of times

    Returns a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 by default, and increments by 1 (by default), and ends at a specified number(val - 1)

##### range(start, val)

    Returns a sequence of numbers, starting from (start) by default, and increments by 1 (by default), and ends at a specified number(val - 1)

##### range(start, val, count)

    Returns a sequence of numbers, starting from (start) by default, and increments by (count) and ends at a specified number(val - 1)
